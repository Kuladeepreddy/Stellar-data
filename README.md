This MATLAB script analyzes the spectral data of a star to determine its redshift and radial velocity based on observed wavelengths. The process begins by loading the spectral data from the starData.mat file. It then calculates the wavelength range using a starting wavelength of 630.02 nm, a wavelength increment of 0.14 nm, and the number of observations. The script extracts the spectral data from a specific column and plots the intensity against the wavelength. It identifies the H-alpha spectral line by finding the minimum intensity value and marks this point on the plot. The redshift and radial velocity of the star are then calculated using the observed H-alpha wavelength, the known rest wavelength of the H-alpha line (656.28 nm), and the speed of light (299792.458 km/s). The output includes a plot with the H-alpha line highlighted and the calculated values for redshift and radial velocity displayed in the command window. This analysis helps in understanding the motion of the star relative to Earth.
